#  SCCToolKit Macro
#
#  Since version 2.8.4, cmake provided Qt-related commands such as automoc. Also cmake had macros like qt4_wrap_cpp
#  These coomads and macros assume sources are C++. In SCCToolKit for Mac we use Objective-C++, which causes
#  many errors when applying cmake's built-in Qt functions.
#  Since Qt 5, macros are integrated in Qt package, but the situation was the same.
#   Qt4MacrosExtra.cmake is a set of patches to Qt4 macros to override Qt4Macros.
